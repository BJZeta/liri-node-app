# liri-node-app
## This is my liri app that uses the the BandsInTown, Omdb, and Spotify api

This app allows a user to search song info on a song name, venue information on a band/artist, and imdb info on a movie title 

## To search for a song info....
  ### Type in 'spotify-this-song (song name)'

## To search for info on a concert for a band/artist....
  ### Type in 'concert-this (band/artist name)'
  
## To search for movie info....
  ### Type in 'movie-this (movie title)'
